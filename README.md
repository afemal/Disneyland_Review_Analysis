# Disneyland Review Analysis
## Text-Based Analysis

### Introduction
The Walt Disney Companyâ€™s world-class customer service can be attributed to their implementation of the Five Keys: safety, courtesy, inclusion, show, and efficiency. Though each key is essential and work together to provide an exceptional experience for our guests, I will be focusing on the courtesy key by analyzing the reviews provided by the park guests. Using reviews provided by Disneyland park guests on Trip Advisor, I set out to answer the following questions:

  * What was the overall rating of each park?
  * Which topics are trending among satisfied guests?
  * Which topics are trending among unsatisfied guests?
  * What are potential solutions to improve the guest experience?

It is important to understand the strengths and weakness of each park. Trending topics for satisfied guests indicate aspects of what Disney is doing well and should continue doing. Those that are trending for unsatisfied guests indicate areas that Disney can improve upon.
